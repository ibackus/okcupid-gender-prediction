This repository contains Isaac Backus' Machine Learning final project for [CSE 546: Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse546/16au/) at University of Washington.

The goal of this project was to predict a person's gender from their OkCupid profile responses.
The dataset used is a [publicly available](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid), small set of OkCupid profiles.
The data is reproduced here for convenience.
